Once they were in, hackers ran wild in your systems, causing permanent physical damage. Plant workers have died, AquaVolt's CISO has been fired, and there's a high chance you'll be arrested for corporate manslaughter. AquaVolt Power has had to shut down, permanently. Only a few hours until the lights go off now... ",

AquaVolt fell victim to a few preventable cyber attacks due to your choice to not implement appropriate preventative security measures. However, the defences you did implement protected AquaVolt from many other attacks. As you've experienced, many organisations have a very tight budget. The important thing is to detect vulnerabilities and secure them, whilst also considering the general security and ensuring regulatory compliance. It can be a very difficult situation! Fortunately for you, AquaVolt didn’t suffer too greatly, and can continue their regular operations.",

Many big organisations suffer major cyber attacks, however, they are able to learn from them, and always endeavour to be more prepared for subsequent attacks.",

You implemented choice security measures to prevent any system intrusion, and in the event they were bypassed, your defence-in-depth ensured any damage done was minimal. A system can never be 100% secure, however, you prioritised the most important aspects of the system, and implemented well-chosen security measures in an excellently chosen order. You've already been offered a permanent security position at AquaVolt, but your career will certainly reach great heights beyond there.",
