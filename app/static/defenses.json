One of the main causes of cyberattacks is a lack of awareness – many employees fall victim to phishing scams, which can result in serious consequences for the whole organisation. Hence, a quick course in basic cybersecurity can prevent a great deal of damage. These courses usually involve: identifying different types of threats (spam, phishing, malware, ransomware, etc.), importance of password security, policies to adhere to, data protection and identifying and reporting threats. Employees are an organisation’s first line of defence... educating them is key!",
